Task 5: Handling a Real-World Git Merge Conflict

Critical Thinking Project – Source Code Management for a Distributed Development Team


---

1. Introduction

In a distributed development environment, merge conflicts are one of the most common challenges, especially when multiple developers work on related files or features simultaneously. In this scenario, two developers working on separate branches accidentally caused conflicting changes to be merged into the main branch after a failed merge operation. This task demonstrates how to resolve the conflict, restore code integrity, and implement workflow improvements to reduce such occurrences in the future.


---

2. Reproducing the Problem

The issue occurred because:

Two developers modified the same section of code

Both attempted to merge their branches into main

A failed merge was pushed before resolving conflicts

The main branch now contains conflict markers and broken code


This requires a manual conflict resolution and an update to team workflow practices.


---

3. Steps to Resolve the Merge Conflict

Step 1: Switch to the Main Branch

git checkout main

Step 2: Pull the Latest Changes

This brings the latest (conflicted) version of main into your local environment:

git pull

If conflicts appear during this pull, Git will alert you with messages like:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/app.js
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and commit the result.


---

Step 3: Identify the Conflicting Files

Run:

git status

This shows all files with conflicts, such as:

both modified:   src/app.js
both modified:   src/config/settings.json


---

Step 4: Open the Conflicted Files

Conflicts appear in the file like this:

<<<<<<< HEAD
code from main branch
=======
code from feature branch
>>>>>>> feature/login-update

Explanation of sections:

HEAD refers to the code currently in the main branch.

The section below the divider (=======) is from the feature branch being merged.

You must manually choose one, the other, or combine both.



---

Step 5: Resolve the Conflict

To resolve, remove the conflict markers and edit the file to the correct combined version.
For example:

// Final resolved version
function loginUser() {
    validateInput();
    authenticateUser();  
    logAccessTime();  // Keep new addition from feature branch
}


---

Step 6: Stage and Commit the Resolved Files

git add src/app.js
git add src/config/settings.json

git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between main and feature updates"


---

Step 7: Push the Fixed Code Back to the Server

git push

If branch protection rules require a pull request, open a PR and request review.


---

4. Restoring Code Integrity

After resolving conflicts:

Run unit tests

Build the application

Deploy to staging


This ensures that the conflict resolution did not introduce new issues.


---

5. Preventing Future Merge Conflicts

Conflicts cannot be eliminated completely, but the following workflow improvements will reduce their frequency and impact.


---

5.1 Encourage Smaller, More Frequent Pull Requests

Smaller PRs:

Reduce the chance of overlapping changes

Make code easier to review

Detect issues earlier



---

5.2 Require Developers to Pull Frequently

Developers should frequently run:

git fetch origin
git pull origin main

This keeps their local branches updated, preventing divergence.


---

5.3 Enforce Pull Request Reviews

Add a rule:

✔ At least one developer must review PRs before merging.

This prevents incomplete merges and conflicting code from being pushed prematurely.


---

5.4 Improve Branching Strategy

Clear branch naming convention:

feature/*

bugfix/*

hotfix/*


and ensuring all features branch off the latest main helps avoid outdated code.


---

5.5 Introduce Automated CI Checks

Before merging, automatically verify:

✔ Code compiles
✔ Tests pass
✔ Linter shows no errors

This prevents broken or partially merged code from entering main.


---

5.6 Improve Team Communication

Developers must coordinate when working on large or overlapping features:

Use Slack/Teams for quick updates

Notify the team before starting major refactoring

Maintain a shared Kanban board showing who is editing what



---

5.7 Require Rebase Before Merging

Feature branches should be rebased with main before merge:

git checkout feature/login-update
git pull --rebase origin main

This minimizes the chances of conflicts during merging.


---

6. Summary

This task demonstrated how to resolve a real-world merge conflict by:

Pulling the latest code

Identifying conflicting files

Manually resolving the conflict in each file

Committing and pushing the fixed version


Additionally, several workflow improvements were recommended to prevent future conflicts, including:

✔ Frequent updates from main
✔ Smaller pull requests
✔ Required code reviews
✔ Automated CI checks
✔ Clear branching strategy
✔ Stronger team communication
